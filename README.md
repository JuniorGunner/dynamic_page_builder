# Dynamic WebPage Builder

## What It Does
The Dynamic WebPage Builder is a web-based tool that enables users to easily create web pages by dynamically adding and configuring HTML elements. Users can visualize their page content in real-time, confirm its design, and then render the final product seamlessly.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Running Locally
1. **Setup Django Environment**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone [your-repo-url]`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd [your-project-name]`
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
   - Activate the virtual environment: 
     - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - On Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Run Migrations (Outside Docker)**
   - Set up the database: `python manage.py makemigrations`
   - Apply the migrations: `python manage.py migrate`

3. **Run with Docker**
   - Build the Docker image: `docker build -t dynamic-page-builder .`
   - Run the Docker container: `docker run -d -p 8000:8000 dynamic-page-builder`

Now, you can navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

## Future Improvements
1. **Enhanced UI/UX**: Develop a more intuitive drag-and-drop interface for adding and configuring HTML elements.
2. **Additional Element Support**: Expand the variety of HTML elements that users can add, including more complex components like sliders and carousels.
3. **Templates**: Offer users a selection of pre-designed templates to start their page designs.
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that user-created pages are mobile-responsive by default.
5. **Integration with CSS Frameworks**: Allow users to choose from popular CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, or Tailwind for styling their pages.
