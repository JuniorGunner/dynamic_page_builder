# Dynamic WebPage Builder

## What It Does
The Dynamic WebPage Builder is a web-based tool that enables users to easily create web pages by dynamically adding and configuring HTML elements. Users can visualize their page content in real-time, confirm its design, and then render the final product seamlessly.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Running Locally
1. **Setup Django Environment**
   - Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:JuniorGunner/dynamic_page_builder.git`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd dynamic_page_builder`
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
   - Activate the virtual environment: 
     - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - On Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Run Migrations (Outside Docker)**
   - Set up the database: `python manage.py makemigrations`
   - Apply the migrations: `python manage.py migrate`

3. **Run with Docker using Makefile**
   - Build the Docker image: `make build`
   - Run the Docker container: `make run`

To access other utilities, such as creating a superuser, making migrations, or collecting static files, you can utilize the respective commands from the Makefile, e.g., `make createsuperuser`.

Now, you can navigate to http://localhost:8000 to access the application.

## Future Improvements
1. **Enhanced UI/UX**: Develop a more intuitive drag-and-drop interface for adding and configuring HTML elements.
2. **Additional Element Support**: Expand the variety of HTML elements that users can add, including more complex components like sliders and carousels.
3. **Templates**: Offer users a selection of pre-designed templates to start their page designs.
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that user-created pages are mobile-responsive by default.
5. **Integration with CSS Frameworks**: Allow users to choose from popular CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, or Tailwind for styling their pages.
6. **Unit Tests**: Implement comprehensive unit tests to cover the entirety of the project.
